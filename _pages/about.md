I'm a first-year CS Ph.D. student at [University of Waterloo][7], advised by [Wenhu Chen][6]. I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University][0], where I was fortunate to work closely with Prof. [Zhao Zhou][8]. I was a research intern at [USC INK-Lab][9], advised by Prof. [Xiang Ren][1] and [(Bill)Yuchen Lin][5]. 

Iâ€™m interested in Natural Language Processing, especially Commonsense Reasoning, Text generation, and all sorts of application research of Large Language Models.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
