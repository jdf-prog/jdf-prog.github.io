I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student of [TIGER-Lab][12] at [University of Waterloo][7], advised by Prof. [Wenhu Chen][6]. Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University][0]. I am currently interning at [NVIDIA ADLR]([13]) at Santa Clara. 

My research focus on LLM/VLM-post training, including alignment, evaluation, and applications. Recently I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks and how they can better use tools to solve problems. I built [VerlTool](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool) as an initial exploration of this direction with a neat and easy-to-use codebase.
