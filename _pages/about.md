I'm a first-year CS Ph.D. student of [TIGER-Lab][12] at [University of Waterloo][7], advised by Prof. [Wenhu Chen][6]. Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University][0], advised Prof. [Zhao Zhou][8]. I was a research intern at USC INK-Lab advised by [Xiang Ren][1]. I am also an incoming summer intern at [Allen Institute for AI][11], where I will work with [(Bill)Yuchen Lin][5] and [Lianhui Qin][10]

My research focus on General Artificial Intelligence and their applications. I am particularly interested in understanding the behavior of LLMs and and multimodality reasoning, as well as their evaluation.
